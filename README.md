# Creating-Lambda-Functions-Using-the-AWS-SDK-for-Python
In this lab, I will use the AWS SDK for Python (boto3) to create AWS Lambda functions. Calls to the REST API that I created in the earlier Amazon API Gateway lab will initiate the functions. One of the Lambda functions will perform either an Amazon DynamoDB database table scan or an index scan.
